 1. Indoor Voice
Description:
indoor.py is a simple program that prompts the user for input text and outputs it all in lowercase. This demonstrates basic string methods and working with input() and print().

Skills Practiced:
Reading user input
Using string methods (.lower())
Printing output

 2. Playback Speed
Description:
playback.py prompts the user for input text and slows down the playback by replacing every space with ... to mimic pausing between words.

Skills Practiced:

String replacement (.replace())
User input and output formatting

 3. Making Faces
Description:
faces.py includes a convert function that replaces :) with üôÇ and :( with üôÅ to convert old-school emoticons to modern emoji. A main function handles user input and displays the converted text.

Skills Practiced:
Defining and calling functions
String replacement with .replace()
Combining multiple functions in one file

 4. Einstein
Description:
einstein.py calculates energy (in Joules) equivalent to a given mass in kilograms using Einstein‚Äôs famous equation E = mc¬≤. The speed of light c is assumed to be 300,000,000 m/s.

Skills Practiced:
Working with integers
Performing arithmetic operations
Using variables and constants

üìå 5. Tip Calculator
Description:
This project expands a tip calculator by implementing two helper functions:
dollars_to_float removes $ and converts the input to a float.
percent_to_float removes % and converts the input to a decimal fraction.
The calculator then uses these to compute how much tip to leave.

Skills Practiced:
String slicing and stripping characters
Converting strings to floats
Simple percentage calculations
Combining multiple functions

 Challenges & Lessons Learned
Git & Navigation:
I practiced navigating directories using the terminal and learned to manage files and run Python scripts from the command line.

Functions & Variables:
I learned how to break down problems using functions and pass data between them.

String Manipulation:
I practiced different string methods and replacements to process user input.

‚úÖ How to Run
To run any program, open your terminal, navigate to the project folder, and use:

bash
Copy code
python indoor.py
python playback.py
python faces.py
python einstein.py
python tip.py
